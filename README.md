# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was designed to help Coding Bootcamp students study key topics, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  The webpage places all important details about each topic into one easy to reach place so that students can access it whenever questions arise, or they have time to study.  Through the development of this project, I took a deeper dive into each of these topics, put them into practice, and experienced a glimpse into what it means to be a website developer.

If the console is opened, you can see the JavaScript running.  It will list the topics we learned during the prework project and give a suggestion of what topic to study first.
